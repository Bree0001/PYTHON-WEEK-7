# Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the final assignment for **Week 7: Basic Data Analysis** in the Software Development - February 2025 Cohort.

## Project Overview

We analyze the popular Iris dataset using Python libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`. The analysis includes:

- Loading and cleaning the dataset
- Computing summary statistics and grouped statistics
- Visualizing the data using multiple chart types

## Files Included

- `iris.csv` – The dataset used (locally saved)
- `Iris_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb` – The complete Jupyter Notebook
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

- Loaded the CSV using `pandas`
- Displayed the first few rows with `.head()`
- Checked data types and missing values

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

- Computed mean, median, standard deviation using `.describe()`
- Grouped data by species and computed averages

### Task 3: Data Visualization

Created and customized the following charts:
- Line chart showing petal length trends
- Bar chart for average sepal width per species
- Histogram for petal length distribution
- Scatter plot showing sepal vs. petal length

## Getting Started

To run this notebook:
1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
